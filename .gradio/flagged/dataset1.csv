matchups against ahri,"<think>
Okay, the user is asking about matchups against Ahri. Let me check the info provided.

First, the data says Ahri is strong against Lux because of her mobility and ultimate engage. Then, she's countered by Kassadin due to his magic shield and scaling. Also, there are tips for Ahri players, like using charm for combos and roaming.

The user wants to know how to play against Ahri. So, I should mention Kassadin as a counter and explain why. Also, even though Lux is weak against Ahri, maybe mention that as a bad matchup. But the user might be looking for both counters and who Ahri counters. Wait, the question is ""matchups against Ahri,"" so they want to know which champions are good or bad against her.

So, structure the answer with counters (like Kassadin) and champions Ahri beats (like Lux). Then add general tips for facing Ahri, like dodging charm, respecting her",2025-05-07 19:15:58.415163
